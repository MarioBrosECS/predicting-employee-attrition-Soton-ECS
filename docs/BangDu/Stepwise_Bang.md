# Stepwise regression 
### concept
-Put the variables introduced into the model one by one, each variable will be verified by F test and the selected variables will be verified by t test. The variable will be deleted when the previously imported variable becomes out of character due to the import of the latest variable, which can ensures that the regression equation contains only variables with salient features before each new variable is imported.
-It can guarantee that feature set is optimal.
